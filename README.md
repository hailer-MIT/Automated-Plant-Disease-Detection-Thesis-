# üåø Automated Plant Disease Detection Using CNN

## üß† Problem Statement

Manual identification of plant diseases is time-consuming, error-prone, and inaccessible to small-scale farmers. Early detection is crucial for minimizing crop loss, yet many lack the tools for efficient disease diagnosis.

## ‚úÖ Solution

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to automate the detection of plant diseases from leaf images. Built as part of a thesis project, it aims to support sustainable agriculture through accessible AI-driven diagnosis.

## üîß Approach

We trained a CNN model using a Kaggle-hosted dataset of healthy and diseased plant leaf images. The model was optimized for high accuracy using image augmentation and dropout layers to prevent overfitting. A backend (Django REST API) and a Flutter-based mobile interface were developed to make the system accessible to end-users, including farmers.

The approach includes:
- Image preprocessing & augmentation
- CNN architecture with 4 convolutional layers
- TensorFlow/Keras model training
- Integration with mobile frontend using Flutter
- Backend API built using Django for model inference

## üß™ Results

- **Training Accuracy:** ~98%
- **Validation Accuracy:** ~95%
- Successfully deployed in a mobile interface for testing.
- Selected for presentation at a Science and Technology international conference.
